        <h1>The Crystal Keep</h1>
        <p>In the porous mountains on the edge of creation exists a beautiful land, with strong people, faithful wives, beautiful women, and beautiful men. This continent, caved inward like a bowl on the world, is named Walnutia, as well one of its great states. Walnutia. And the capital of that State. Walnutia. Where the greatest minds live, holding forward the path of humanity, they strive to one day reach for the heavens beyond for Psydon. Most elves inhabit this continent, and although they're not the bulk of the people, they're considered the elder folk guiding forward the Walnutians.<br><br>
          <p>Right besides it, towards the south is the Crystal Keep. A humble land with nice people. <br><br>
        The Crystal Keep, accordingly named by the first King Tibursio, was thusly named for their abundance of magical crystals that scattered across the land. The great king built many castles and died in his most favorite one, across a small lake in a small town. Where he was free to worship his gods as he pleased, and set his own taxes, and enslave the native populace of crystal born creachers.<br><br>
        Generations passed, and wounds were licked. It was only recently that the Crystal Keep garnered attention from the surrounding lands.<br>

        <h2>The Ten Gods</h2>
        <p>Humen, the bulk of life in the world, were all created by the 10 gods. Bless their mercy, the ten whom came together, an oddity, to create the greatest of creachers.<br><br>
       Scholars do not know why the gods created Humen, as Xylix, the trickster, changed the answer Noc gave to humanity. But, the answer is clear to all Men. To rule over the lesser creachers and bring peace and prosperity to the lands, and honor to the inhabitants henceforth.<br><br>
        This, ofcourse meant bringing the Walnutians and Elves and Dwarves and the inhumen to subjugation. For their own good, and for the good of the civilization at large, praise Ravox. Those who resisted would be crushed under the heel of humen empathetic grappling, praise Dendor. </p>

        <h2>The Treaty</h2>
        <p>Not too long ago, a treaty was made between Walnutia, Crystal Keep, and the Walnut Woods Confederacy.<br><br>
        In order to preserve life and self independence, the Crystal Keep kingdom would graciously allow many a /people/ to inhabit Crystal Keep. For which, in return, the Walnutians yielded their unprovoked savage violence against the innocent humen farmers of the Crystal Keep.  <br><br>
        This marks good relations between Walnutia and the Crystal Keep. After all, their god, although not one of the ten, and technically (by Noc scholar standards) considered an inhumen god, Psydon was recently revealed to have once lived in the areas that is the Crystal Keep. For this, many a visitors come to investigate the claim. Both friendly, and not.</p>
